# Veinfinder Project
This is the GitHub for the veinfinder project. Our project uses an IR emitter array with a NoIR Picam which has a IR pass filter on it. Using this we can see veins on peoples arms.

## Files
### Documentation
This folder contains all of our documentation. This includes the assignments submitted throughout the semester along with our technical documentation.

### Images
This folder contains our images. This includes the original dataset along with the augmented dataset. The Images folder also contains the C# code which augments our images. It is recommended you run this augmentation code on any new images as it greatly improves the models preformance.

### ML Models
This folder contains all of the models which we have deemed as successful. This is only the output from Rich's models. The actual models are too large to be uploaded to GitHub so they can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DGls1SB5syulKGr5hgQqLpTfuY4aNmA4?usp=sharing
